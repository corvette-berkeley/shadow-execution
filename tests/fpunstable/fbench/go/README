This directory contains a version of the floating point benchmark
in Google's Go language.  It was ported from the C version by
John Nagle (http://www.animats.com/) in July 2013.

It has been tested with:
    go version go1.1.1 linux/amd64
under Ubuntu Linux:
    Linux hayek 2.6.38-16-generic #67-Ubuntu SMP Thu Sep 6 17:58:38 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
and produces the same results as the reference C implementation.

You can build ann executable with:
    make
and then run a timing test with:
    make time
or manually run a timing test with:
    ./fbench <number_of_iterations>
If the iteration count is negative, the test will run in batch
mode, otherwise it will pause to allow you to start and stop
an external timer.

Reference runs should adjust the number of iterations so the
benchmark runs around five minutes.

The code includes internal timing and checking of the numerical
results.
