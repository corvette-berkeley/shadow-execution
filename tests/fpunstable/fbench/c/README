This directory contains two versions of the main floating point benchmark:
fbench.c and fbench_ansi.c.  Fbench was developed in the 1980s, when ANSI
C was just beginning to be supported by C compilers.  To maximise portability,
it was written in "classic" K&R (Kernighan and Ritchie) C.  This dialect of C
is still supported by most contemporary compilers, but the original code may
result in warning messages when compiled.

The fbench_ansi.c program is functionally identical, but expressed in ANSI C,
adhering to Fourmilab's present day coding standards (which, for example,
never omit braces on conditional or loop statements, even if the language
allows it).  This implementation of fbench compiles without warnings on
GCC 4.5.2 with the -Wall option.  The fbench_ansi.c source code uses ANSI
const declarations to document declarations of constants and is careful
that the values it returns (or doesn't) from functions match their
declarations.

In a rational universe fbench.c and fbench_ansi.c should run at precisely
the same speed, but since most of the archival runs of fbench were made
with fbench.c, it remains available for comparison in case the migration
to ANSI syntax should affect performance.
